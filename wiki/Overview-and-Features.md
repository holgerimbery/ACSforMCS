# Overview and Features

## Project Overview

**ACSforMCS** (Azure Communication Services for Microsoft Customer Service) is a cutting-edge .NET 9 web application that revolutionizes customer service by bridging traditional telephony with modern conversational AI. This solution enables customers to interact naturally with Microsoft Copilot Studio virtual agents through regular phone calls, combining the universal accessibility of telephony with the intelligence of AI-powered customer service.

### **Data Flow Process**

1. **Call Initiation**: Customer dials the ACS phone number
2. **Event Trigger**: Azure Communication Services triggers an EventGrid webhook
3. **Call Connection**: Application answers the call and starts transcription
4. **Bot Conversation**: DirectLine conversation is initiated with Copilot Studio
5. **Speech Processing**: Audio is transcribed to text and sent to the bot
6. **Bot Response**: Bot responses are converted to speech and played to the caller
7. **Conversation Loop**: Process continues until completion or transfer
8. **Call Management**: Transfer to human agent or graceful termination
