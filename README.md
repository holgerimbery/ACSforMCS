# telephony channel for Copilot Studio via Azure Communication Services

## Overview

This project showcases a telephony integration between **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** and **Microsoft Copilot Studio (MCS)** virtual agents. 
The application creates a voice-based customer service experience by:

1. Accepting incoming phone calls through ACS
2. Converting speech to text using real-time transcription
3. Sending the transcribed content to a Copilot Studio agent via the Direct Line API
4. Transforming the agent's responses into spoken audio using SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)
5. Delivering the synthesized speech back to the caller
6. Transfer the call to an external phone number
7. Monitoring endpoints (secured)
8. Swagger interface (secured when running in Development Mode, disable in Production Mode)


This solution provides an alternative communication channel for Copilot Studio agents.
enabling organizations to extend their conversational AI capabilities to traditional phone systems
while leveraging the natural language understanding and dialog management features of Microsoft Copilot Studio.
