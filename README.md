# telephony channel for Copilot Studio via Azure Communication Services

## Overview

This project showcases a telephony integration between **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** and **Microsoft Copilot Studio (MCS)** virtual agents. 
The application creates a voice-based customer service experience by:

1. Accepting incoming phone calls through ACS
2. Converting speech to text using real-time transcription
3. Sending the transcribed content to a Copilot Studio agent via the Direct Line API
4. Transforming the agent's responses into spoken audio using SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)
5. Delivering the synthesized speech back to the caller
6. Transfer the call to an external phone number
7. Monitoring endpoints (secured)
8. Swagger interface (secured when running in Development Mode, disable in Production Mode)


This solution provides an alternative communication channel for Copilot Studio agents.
enabling organizations to extend their conversational AI capabilities to traditional phone systems
while leveraging the natural language understanding and dialog management features of Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## Quick Start Deployment

### Option 1: One-Click Azure Deployment (Recommended)
Deploy everything with an interactive Azure Portal interface:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fholgerimbery%2FACSforMCS%2Fdeplyonazurebutton%2Fazuredeploy.json/createUIDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fholgerimbery%2FACSforMCS%2Fdeplyonazurebutton%2FcreateUiDefinition.json)

**Post-deployment steps:**
1. Download the latest [release package](https://github.com/holgerimbery/ACSforMCS/releases)
2. Extract and run `.\setup-configuration.ps1` to configure phone number and DirectLine secret
3. Run `.\deploy-application.ps1` to deploy your application code

### Option 2: New Projects (Automated Setup)
For new projects without existing Azure resources, use our automated setup:

```powershell
# 1. Download and extract the latest release package
# 2. Create all Azure resources automatically
.\scripts\create-azure-resources.ps1 -ApplicationName "myproject"

# 3. Populate Key Vault secrets interactively  
.\scripts\populate-keyvault-secrets.ps1 -KeyVaultName "kv-myproject-prod"

# 4. Deploy the application
.\scripts\deploy-application.ps1
```

### Option 3: Existing Azure Resources
If you already have Azure resources configured:

```powershell
# 1. Download and extract the latest release package
# 2. Configure application with existing resources
.\scripts\setup-configuration.ps1 -KeyVaultName "your-keyvault-name"

# 3. Deploy the application
.\scripts\deploy-application.ps1
```
